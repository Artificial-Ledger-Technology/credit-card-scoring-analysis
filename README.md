## Introduction

The credit card scoring analysis project utilizes machine learning algorithms to assess the creditworthiness of individuals based on their financial and personal information. By training models on historical data, the project aims to predict credit card scores, which can be used to determine credit limits, interest rates, and approval decisions.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-scoring-analysis.git 
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd credit-card-scoring-analysis  
```

3.Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
1. Prepare the data:
* Collect customer data including financial information, employment details, and personal attributes.

* Preprocess the data by cleaning, transforming, and encoding categorical variables as necessary.

2. Train the models: 
* Select the appropriate machine learning algorithms for credit card scoring, such as logistic regression, random forests, or gradient boosting.

* Split the data into training and testing sets.

* Train the models using the training data.

3. Evaluate the models:
* Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.

* Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one for credit card scoring analysis.

4. Predict credit card scores: 
* Use the trained models to predict the credit card scores for new, unseen customer data.

* Interpret the credit card scores and make informed decisions based on the risk profile and creditworthiness of individuals.

# Data Collection

The project requires customer data to train and test the models. Ensure that the data is obtained from reliable sources and complies with privacy and security regulations. Examples of datasets for credit card scoring analysis include publicly available credit bureau data or proprietary datasets from financial institutions.

# Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the data for machine learning. It involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, normalizing the features, and encoding categorical variables. Implement the necessary preprocessing steps based on the characteristics of the data and the requirements of the chosen machine learning algorithms.

# Model Training 
Select the appropriate machine learning algorithms for credit card scoring analysis. Commonly used algorithms include logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, or support vector machines. Train the models using the preprocessed data and tune the hyperparameters to optimize performance.

# Model Evaluation 
Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one for credit card scoring analysis. Consider the business requirements and risk tolerance levels in determining the optimal credit card scoring model.

# Results
Present the results of the credit card scoring analysis models. Include metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score, to evaluate the model's performance. Discuss the effectiveness of the models in predicting credit card scores and any insights gained from the analysis.
